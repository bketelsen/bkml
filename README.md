## Built with CueBlox

This repository contains data that is built with [CueBlox](https://github.com/cueblox/blox). Content and schema are stored in the `/data` directory, and built with a [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/data.yml) on push to `main`. The build output is stored as a draft release with the same name each time, to give it a [consistent path](https://github.com/bketelsen/bkml/releases/download/blox/data.json) that can be referenced from external tools.
