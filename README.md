# Brian's Modern Life

Welcome! 👋🏻

## Built with CueBlox

This repository contains data that is built with [CueBlox](https://github.com/cueblox/blox). Content and schema are stored in the `/data` directory, and built with a [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/data.yml) on push to `main`. The build output is stored as a draft release with the same name each time, to give it a [consistent path](https://github.com/bketelsen/bkml/releases/download/blox/data.json) that can be referenced from external tools.


## Credits
"Modern Life" is lifted from [David Flanigan](https://twitter.com/rawkode) idea of a monorepo that stores all data in YAML/Markdown files and acts as the source of truth for any other downstream systems.
